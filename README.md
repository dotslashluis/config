# DotSlashLuis' configuration files

## What is this

These are some dotfiles and configurations that I've created and don't want to redo when I reinstall my system or when I accidentally break something.

## Disclaimer

These dotfiles were made for a Lenovo Ideapad 330s-15ARR with Arch Linux as it's host OS.  If you use these Xorg configuration files it is not guarenteed to work if you PC doesn't adhere to these specifications.

## What is in this repository

* Qtile configuration script and some scripts to make the experience more comfortable # EXTREMELY DEPRECATED.  DO NOT USE IT IF YOU EVER CLONE THIS REPO

* Xorg configuration files for the touchpad and for the AMDGPU driver

* Alacritty's configuration file

## What do I want to add to the repository

* Fish' configuration file

* A dependency list so that I can reinstall everything easily. (Kinda implemented)
